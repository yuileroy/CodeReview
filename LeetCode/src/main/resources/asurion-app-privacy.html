            &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Mobile Analytics</strong></p>
        <p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our application on
            your
            phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that
            occur
            within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
            We do
            not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information
            you
            submit within the mobile application.</p>
        <p><strong>A few notes about social media</strong></p>
        <p>Please be aware that any information that you submit to a social media site such as Facebook, Instagram or
            Twitter is done at your own risk and without any expectation of privacy. Asurion cannot control the actions
            of
            social media site users and is not responsible for any content or submissions contained on such sites. You
            should always review the privacy policy of any third party website or application.</p>
        <p>By using any functionality that permits submissions to social media sites, you are indicating that you have
            reviewed the applicable privacy policy and terms of use of that site. Additionally, in the event that we
            offer
            functionality through the application that permits the posting of content on social media, please be aware
            that
            these sites may allow you to publicly post, and share this content. Asurion cannot guarantee the privacy
            and
            safety of these sites and is therefore not responsible for any content you post. Use these features at your
            own
            risk.</p>
        <p><strong>An important note regarding Streaming Assistant</strong></p>
        <p>To enable you to onboard streaming services successfully and troubleshoot any issues in your home setup that
            impede your streaming, with your permission, an Asurion expert can perform a Home Network Check-Up. As part
            of the check-up, Asurion collects information about your home network to understand its capabilities (e.g.,
            type of broadband connection, make and model of your router, and maximum download and upload capacity) and
            health (e.g., measured levels of congestion, packet loss, jitter, latency, and throughput). In addition, the
            check-up collects information about the streaming services available in your home and the devices using your
            home network (e.g., your device’s make and model, your device’s Wi-Fi signal strength from router, and the
            maximum speed with which your device can operate with respect to your router). The objective of the check-up
            is to identify any issues (e.g., a device using an unreasonably high amount of bandwidth) and make
            recommendations to you to enhance your in-home streaming.</p>
        <p><strong>Children under 13</strong></p>
        <p>The application is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from
            children under 13. If you become aware that your child is accessing the application and providing Personal
            Information without your consent, please contact us by using the information provided below. We will take
            steps
            to remove Personal Information from our storage systems and terminate the account if we determine that a
            child
            under 13 has accessed the application.</p>
        <p><strong>For non-U.S. residents</strong></p>
        <p>We may transfer Information that we collect about you outside of the country in which it was
            collected.&nbsp;
            If
            you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that
            may
            differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring Information about yourself, including your
            Information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as the European

            Information, to the U.S. you are also consenting to the use and disclosure of Information about yourself,
